# Book Shelf Project

This is the full compleated project I made. I started with the Udacity Starter Kit for this project and achived all the requerements.

At the first startup of the app the user will get a bunch of books in gis shelf divided by three categories "Currently Reading", "Want To Read" and "Read". The user can move the books between the categories.

Clicking on the "+" button will navigate to a search page. There the user can search for new books to add to his personal shelf also by category.

## Installation

To get started developing right away:

* Clone this repository: https://github.com/dor4231/book_shelf.git
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `yarn start`

This will open a browser and you can see the application ;).

## Addintional information

I used react to build this whole application. Also used the BookAPI Udacity probided for me.
